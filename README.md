# PHP Contact Form

## Introduction
In order to get more familiar with PHP, forms and their exact workings, this project is simple. I'm building a working HTML form page that has working underlying PHP. 

## Goals
To have a working contact form, error messages and, as an end result, the option to actually send the forms content as an email.

## Features
Right now, the form allows the user to indicate his intent. This tells us if the user is trying to give us feedback, ask a question or suggest a new feature. The user can also indicate wether or not they want us to contact them. 

The messages the user sees will depend on what they've chosen there.

## Methods and tools
I hosted the files on 000webhosting, a free and easy solution. To be frank, I wouldn't host anything important here, but the low treshold makes it perfect for this assignment.
