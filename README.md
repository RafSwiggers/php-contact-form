# PHP Contact Form

## Introduction
In order to get more familiar with PHP, forms and their exact workings, this project is simple. I'm building a working HTML form page that has working underlying PHP. 

## Goals
To have a working contact form, error messages and, as an end result, the option to actually send the forms content as an email.

### Stay tuned for the rend result.
